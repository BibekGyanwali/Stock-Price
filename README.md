# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This project demonstrates the prediction of stock prices using machine learning models. It explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The aim is to provide a framework for analyzing stock price trends and making short-term predictions.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Retrieves historical stock price data from sources like Yahoo Finance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes stock price trends and key statistics.
- **Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Includes technical indicators like moving averages.
- **Prediction Models:** Implements model LSTM.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Metrics MSE used to evaluate model accuracy.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
